#  Legacy of Earth civilization based on a movie dataset.

## Abstract

What if aliens discovered Earth long after we disappeared, and tried to guess what our civilization looks like thanks to the only thing that survived : movies ?
As a first step, we want to analyze the database to reboot the average human being. Then, use movie synopses to produce a graph of relationships between countries in the world, and finally correlate these assumptions to the actual. 
Also, we are interested in investigating possible correlations or causal links between the names of the actors and the names of the population.
We finally want to study the realism/representativity of a subpool of movies contained in the dataset, by elaborating a metrics system that evaluates how the pool fits the human society. Eventually, we wonder what types of data would be most useful to pass on as a legacy for other civilizations, so they can understand human society.

- Can we infer the main relations between countries by analyzing synopses, and draw a weighted map of countries ?
- Can we elaborate a metrics system that would rate the likelihood of pools of movies on arbitrary criteria about the Earth population, cities, countries, etc ?


## Complementary datasets

Names dataset: here. The idea is to show if a correlation does exist between famous actor/character and baby names. 7Mb database.

## Methods

Description from aliens point of view, and estimation of errors based on actual values: 
TASK_1: robot portrait vs reality (ethnicity, occupation, size): means, distributions (occupation, age of the actors at the movie release)
TASK_2: influence of characters/actor names on baby names, 
TASK_3: countries relationships, 
TASK_4: metric that describes the distance of a pool of movies from reality ().
