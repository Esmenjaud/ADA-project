#  Legacy of Earth civilization based on a movie dataset.

## Abstract

As a first step, we want to analyze the database to reboot the average human being. Then, we want to use the movies to produce a graph of relationships between countries in the world.
Then we will correlate that to the actual. We also want to study the realism/representativity of a subpool of movies contained in the dataset, by elaborating a metrics system that evaluates how the pool fits the human society.
Also, we are interested in investigating possible correlations or causal links between the names of the actors and the names of the population.
Eventually, we wonder what types of data would be most useful to send to space for other civilizations to understand human society.

- What should the typical human look like, if the only information we had about them was this dataset ?
- Is there a correlation between babiesâ€™ names distribution and films ? If yes, is it possible to determine if th
- Can we infer the main relations between countries by analyzing synopses, and draw a weighted map of countries ?
- Can we elaborate a metrics system that would rate the likelihood of pools of movies on arbitrary criteria about the Earth population, cities, countries, etc ?


## Complementary datasets

Names dataset: here. The idea is to show if a correlation does exist between famous actor/character and baby names. 7Mb database.

## Methods

Description from aliens point of view, and estimation of errors based on actual values: 
TASK_1: robot portrait vs reality (ethnicity, occupation, size): means, distributions (occupation, age of the actors at the movie release)
TASK_2: influence of characters/actor names on baby names, 
TASK_3: countries relationships, 
TASK_4: metric that describes the distance of a pool of movies from reality ().
